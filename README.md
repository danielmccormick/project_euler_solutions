**My take of solutions to project euler questions**

[Project Euler](projecteuler.net) is a website dedicated to mathematical computation problems. *In general*, they are too complex to solve by hand or through slow-trial and error, so the idea is you have to come up with some tricks on how to do them.



Don't read this unless you want the solutions to be spoiled - it's much more fun if you solve them yourself.
